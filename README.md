OOP Design Challenge:

In this project, I have created a few classes to demonstrate the following:

class composition- class being composed of other objects
class inheritance- Simple Super/sub inheritance 
multiple class inheritance- a little more complex but a highly efficient way to write a more DRY code

Methods that use/modify class attributes:
Class methods(cls), instance methods (self) and staticmethods(does not pass anything)

All componets were kept public (did not use __private and _protected access modifiers) I wanted my methods to be accessible outside the classes- from anywhere in the program.

Overriding is demonstrated and object instatiation fro each class is demonstrated throughout the project.
